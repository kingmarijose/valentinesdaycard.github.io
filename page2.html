I know that I have not been around lately, I haven't been in contact with all of you recently, and I haven't been very vocal with my thoughts, nor expressive with my feelings but I hope you know that I care for you all deeply.</p>
                <hr>
                <p> I hope you are all doing well back there, that you are all together more often than usual, and you're all staying healthy. I know that we are apart and there is nothing we can do about that right now but you are always in my thoughts and in my heart. You are the drive that keeps me motivated to continue my studies. Take care of each other. I miss you all and I wish to see you soonest. I love you.</p></H4>
